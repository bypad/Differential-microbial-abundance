# Differential-microbial-abundance

DATA:
- A BIOM table that contains abundance counts for various OTUs across a number of samples from the throat and nose of smokers and non-smokers: otu_table.biom
- A metadata file that provides additional information about each sample: metadata.txt
- A taxonomy file that allows you to link the ID of each OTU to an actual name: 97_otu_taxonomy.txt

PART 1: Understand how smoking impacts the nose and throat microbiomes. 
- Identify which bacteria have a differential abundance between the nose and throat (irrespective of the smoking status).
- Identify which bacteria have a differential abundance between smokers and non-smokers (irrespective of the sampling site).
- Identify which bacteria have a differential abundance in the nose between smokers and non-smokers. Identify which bacteria have a differential abundance in the throat between smokers and non-smokers.

PART 2: Continue to work on microbial abundance, but the focus will switch to classification. The overall goal of the analysis is to build simple classifiers to predict whether a given person is a smoker.
- Detail and justify choice of approach
- Build a classifier that predicts whether a person is a smoker based on only nose samples.
- Build a classifier that predicts whether a person is a smoker based on only throat samples.
- Build a classifier that predicts whether a person is a smoker based on the two sample types.
