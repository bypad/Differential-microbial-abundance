# Differential-microbial-abundance

Data:
- A BIOM table that contains abundance counts for various OTUs across a number of samples from the throat and nose of smokers and non-smokers: otu_table.biom
- A metadata file that provides additional information about each sample: metadata.txt
- A taxonomy file that allows you to link the ID of each OTU to an actual name: 97_otu_taxonomy.txt

Part 1: Understand how smoking impacts the nose and throat microbiomes. 

Part 2: Continue to work on microbial abundance, but the focus will switch to classification. The overall goal of the analysis is to build simple classifiers to predict whether a given person is a smoker.
